# Natural Gallery JS v10.0.1 Upgrade

This update upgrades the Natural Gallery JavaScript library from v2.5.0 to v10.0.1, bringing significant improvements and new features while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## What's New in v10.0.1

### Performance Improvements
- **Autonomous Image Loading**: Gallery now decides what images it needs and requests them on-demand
- **Lazy Loading**: Only thumbnails that are visible or about to be visible are loaded
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Modern ES module build is smaller and more efficient
- **Optimized Infinite Scroll**: Better performance during scrolling

### Technical Improvements
- **ES Module Architecture**: Modern JavaScript module system
- **PhotoSwipe v5.x**: Updated lightbox with better performance and features
- **Better Touch Support**: Improved mobile and touch device experience
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Better screen reader and keyboard navigation support

## Backward Compatibility

All existing TYPO3 templates and configurations continue to work without any changes. The upgrade includes a compatibility layer that:

- Converts old option formats to new API
- Handles image data format conversion
- Maintains the global `naturalGalleries` initialization pattern
- Preserves all layout types (Natural, Square, Masonry)

## Migration Notes

### For Developers

If you have custom JavaScript that interacts with galleries, note these changes:

**Old (v2.5.0):**
```javascript
// Global constructor
var gallery = new NaturalGallery(config);
```

**New (v10.0.1):**
```javascript
// ES module classes
import { Natural, Masonry, Square } from 'natural-gallery-js';
var gallery = new Natural(element, options);
```

The TYPO3 extension handles this automatically through the compatibility layer.

### Image Loading Changes

In v2.5.0, TYPO3 had to generate all thumbnails upfront, which could freeze the page. In v10.0.1:

- Thumbnails are generated on-demand
- Only visible images are loaded initially
- Infinite scroll loads images as needed
- Server load is distributed over time

## Testing the Upgrade

After upgrading, verify that:

1. Galleries load and display correctly
2. Lightbox (PhotoSwipe) opens and works
3. Infinite scroll loads additional images
4. Touch/swipe gestures work on mobile
5. Keyboard navigation functions properly

## Configuration Options

All existing TypoScript and FlexForm configurations remain compatible. The options are automatically converted:

- `margin` â†’ `gap`
- `showLabels` logic preserved
- `lightbox` functionality maintained
- Layout selection (`format`) preserved

## Support

If you encounter any issues after the upgrade:

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify all required files are loaded
3. Ensure TYPO3 cache is cleared
4. Test with different gallery configurations
